# marktPilot -- Software Challenge

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to take this challenge as part of my application process. This is my submission to design a wool comparison portal. Please refer to

Duration: It took me about 2 hours to write the initial code in the initial\_code.py file.

It later took me about a day to rethink through the challenge and refactor the code to reduce compilation time, make it more readable and easier to implement with other websites.

## Solution

The portal takes brand names and corresponding product names and searches for available matches from the website.

In the Utils directory, we have the ProductPageReader.py which reads website page information which is then used to scrap the needed data in the WebScrapper.py file.

The core code sits in the Factor directory. This Factory directory can be modified with the relevant billets, website url and tags to be used for the scrapping. Once new factories/ websites are added,

The test cases used for this project are:

1. [https://www.woolplatz.de](https://www.woolplatz.de/)
2. [https://www.marketexpress.com.gh](https://www.marketexpress.com.gh/)
3. [https://www.yarnplaza.com](https://www.yarnplaza.com/)
4.

## Assumptions Made:

1. I could not find the Special double knit product so I assumed it was the same as the Special dk.
2. It was difficult to find delivery times on most of the websites so that information was ignored in my portal.

How to run the code:

## Final Comments

The challenge looked very simple at first glance but was a bit tough through the thought process. I enjoyed working on it as it helped revised some of my python lessons again and learn new stuff.

Some new concepts I had never used but I learnt to execute this task and worth sharing [https://geekyhumans.com/de/create-asynchronous-api-in-python-and-flask/](https://geekyhumans.com/de/create-asynchronous-api-in-python-and-flask/)

I look forward to working with the MarktPilot team. All the best.
