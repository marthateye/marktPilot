Include it with your tailgating gear or have some ice - cold Heineken on hand when watching the game at home. The long - told success story of the Heineken Brewery got its origin over 140 years ago. Heineken Lager Beer has been brewed to be the best since 1873, using our original family recipe.A European import, we are one of the top beer brands in the world, enjoyed by people in more than 190 countries. Our world - class brewing credentials and heritage have made Heineken a highlight of celebrations, barbecues, and tailgates, or just a reward for a job well done. But there’s more behind the red star logo on our label. When your family name is on the label, you care even more. We put a premium on quality with the ingredients and processes we use to continue Gerard Adriaan Heineken’s vision from over a century ago to create the perfect beer. Every drop of Heineken beer is imported from our family - owned brewery in Holland. So, what is the meaning of a “lager”? There are two major beer types in the world: lagers and ales. Simply put, the yeast in lagers ferments at the bottom of the fermentation container, while ale yeasts ferment on the top. Lagers are also generally brewed at cooler temperatures. Lagers typically have a crisper and cleaner flavor than ales, with the light - colored pilsner being a popular version. Try Heineken with a snack or food. Heineken, the world’s top international premium beer brand is proud to sponsor the UEFA Champions League, the world’s most prestigious club football competition. Our relationship with the Champions League dates back to 1994, making us one of their longest standing official partners."
